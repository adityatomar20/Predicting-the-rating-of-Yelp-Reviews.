#Yelp Review Ratings Prediction

In this project, we delve into the realm of sentiment analysis and machine learning to predict Yelp review ratings based on customer feedback. The workflow begins with comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing, where textual features are extracted and transformed using the NLTK library. Exploratory data analysis, visualized through histograms, provides insights into the distribution of review lengths across different star ratings.

The core of the project lies in the implementation of machine learning models to classify reviews into distinct rating categories. Three models are employed: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines. Each model is trained on a subset of the Yelp dataset, and their performances are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

###Use Cases
Business Insights: The predictive models can be utilized by businesses to gain insights into customer sentiment. This information can help identify areas of improvement, strengths, and weaknesses in their products or services.

Review Filtering: The models can be integrated into review platforms to automatically filter and categorize reviews. This enables businesses to quickly identify and respond to critical feedback or highlight positive customer experiences.

Customer Engagement: By understanding the sentiment of reviews, businesses can tailor their responses to customer feedback, fostering better customer relationships and addressing concerns promptly.

###Sample Predictions:
The code includes examples of predicting review ratings for specific cases. It demonstrates how the models can assess the sentiment of a given review, providing a practical understanding of the prediction capabilities.

###Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NLTK
Scikit-learn

###This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of NLP and machine learning techniques applied to real-world customer reviews, offering valuable insights for businesses aiming to enhance their understanding of customer sentiment on platforms like Yelp.
